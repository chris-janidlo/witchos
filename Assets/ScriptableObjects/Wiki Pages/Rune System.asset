  Title: Rune System
  LeadSection:
    Content: '"potion" system - ms paint app with a twist for creating runes. runes
      are small pixel art symbols infused with color magic - for chunking''s sake,
      they only have a handful of colors each. you can only get color by siphoning
      it from consumables that you buy online.'
  BodySections:
  - Content: "1. you open the rune app and choose which rune you want to make. in
      the process, both a blank canvas and a representation of the rune are opened\n2.
      you choose one of the colors of the rune and attune to it somehow\n3. you open
      an ingredient, and siphon the color from that ingredient\n   a. siphoning happens
      in two simultaneous stages. still need to figure out exactly how it works, but
      you siphon the color as if the color space is 2d\n   b. you left click to siphon
      one, and right click to siphon the other. what happens is that the siphoning
      app shows you a meter for each dimension with lines for the target amounts.
      you hold the mouse buttons down to siphon, increasing each meter, and then try
      to let go as close to the lines as possible. the closer to the line you get,
      the better quality the rune will be. you can't un-siphon color, so you more
      or less have one shot to be accurate without wasting color\n4. now that you
      have the color, you can use it some amount of times in the sprite editor - either
      as many as you want, or a finite amount, depending on how it feels. at this
      point, the app works just like regular ms paint"
