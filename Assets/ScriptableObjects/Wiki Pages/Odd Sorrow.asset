  Title: Odd Sorrow
  LeadSection:
    Content: 'The odd sorrow (also old sorrow, odd sadness, old sadness, or just
      "sorrow") was a magical disease that infected humans for the majority of written
      history. Up until its eradication in the late 1800s, the sorrow was thought
      to have affected anywhere from 50% to 90% of the human population, and up to
      100% of magic users. Although it wasn''t fatal by itself, victims often suffered
      a greatly reduced quality of life.


      As the name suggests, the odd sorrow
      was characterized by a combination of reduced positive energy and abnormal
      manifestations. It presented as episodes that lasted up to a week as opposed
      to chronic symptoms. Generally there were only a handful of episodes a year,
      although the frequency increased with greater magical exposure. The vast majority
      of non-mages only displayed physical and emotional sympoms, while magic users
      also showed specifically magical symptoms.


      Following the discovery
      of binary runes and their applications in treating mundane illnesses, a race
      to find cures for extraordinary afflictions ensued. The pattern and color infusions
      required to cure the sorrow were based off of similar patterns used to cure
      the common cold and the flu, and was discovered by Maco Doctorman. Maco''s
      law-weavers quickly cast a patent on the pattern, which is still in force today.
      Maco currently licences the pattern to witch doctors worldwide.'
  BodySections:
  - Content: 'Witch doctors generally divided symptoms into two categories: mundane
      and magical. Non-mages usually only suffered from mundane symptoms, which included
      any of the emotional and physical ailments, while magic users also suffered
      from undeniably magical maladies. The reason for this split in presentation
      is unknown, although the prevailing theory is that higher energy concentrations
      in magic users lead to errant ebbs and flows of the weave that are self-correcting
      in non-mages.


      What follows is a list of common symptoms, divided by
      mundane and non-mundane.


      Mundane:


      * Existential dread

      *
      Extreme loss of apetite

      * Indigestion, sometimes causing diarrhea

      *
      Tightness of breath

      * Persistent feelings of shame, with no other identifiable
      cause

      * Occasionally, depersonalization and complete loss of sense of
      self


      Magical:


      * Inversion of senses - sight becomes sound,
      smell becomes touch

      * Knowledge of terrible facts, which would come
      about in a way that made them impossible to act upon

      * Inability to
      lie

      * Acute but temporary limb growth

      * Visions of cruel and
      unusual beings that occupy space outside of space'
    Title: Symptoms
  - Content: 'The prevaliing theory on the origins of the sorrow link it to malevolant
      energies created by humanity''s fear of death, and the decadence created by
      departure from prehistoric golden ages.


      Most strains of sorrow can
      be traced back to ancient Egypt, specifically from contaminated figs. Figs
      are pollinated by specially evolved wasps in an incestuous, suicidal process.
      Females burrow into unripe fruit, and attempt to lay their eggs, although they
      are only successful in half of all fruits. In those where they successfully
      lay their eggs, their male children mate with their female children, the male
      children die, and the female children escape to continue the process. In those
      fruits where females cannot lay their eggs, the female wasps die and are absorbed
      into the fruit. The only fig fruits that humans can eat are the ones laden
      with wasp corpses.


      There is both fossil and spiritual evidence that
      Sycophaga sycomori, a species of fig wasp, briefly became imbued with all-consuming
      hatred approximately 6,000 years ago. During this time, they also imbued Ficus
      sycomorus, a species of fig tree native to Egypt, with this same hateful energy.
      Modern reconstructions of these cursed figs have shown that, while the figs
      are still edible and taste better than non-cursed figs, they radiate a noticeable
      malevolence. As a result, it is unlikely that the first person to eat this
      forbidden fruit did so unwillingly, or without being aware of the consequences.
      Doing so may have been an act of defiance.'
