  Title: John Maytree
  LeadSection:
    Content: "John Maytree is the founder, President, CEO, Chairman, and majority
      owner of Maco. Widely considered to be one of the most influential mages in
      history, Maytree has created and overseen the development of countless innovations
      since the founding of Maco. His discovery of binary runes in 1859 eventually
      led to the complete eradication of the {odd sorrow:Odd Sorrow}, and his subsequent
      philanthropical initiatives have funded numerous developments in the arts and
      sciences.\n\nRaised in a family of non-wizards, Maytree took \x03interest in
      spiteful magicks from an early age after encounters with a local hag. Determined
      to see them used for good instead of evil, Maytree applied himself to the study
      of magic and earned a top spot in Harvard but Magical. He dropped out in his
      final year in order to found a tarot-card manufacturing business called Maco.
      From there he grew Maco into a multinational magical-services company.\n\nAs
      a direct result of his power and his intertangling with the astral weave, Maytree
      acts as a sort of aether transformer, thus enabling the vast majority of the
      magical output of Maco. He is the only human known to have achieved corporeal
      immortality, drawing scrutiny from government enforcers and conspiracy theorists.
      He currently resides at the top floor of the Maco Headquarters in multiple
      spacetimes."
