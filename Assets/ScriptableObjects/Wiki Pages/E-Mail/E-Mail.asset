  Title: E-Mail
  LeadSection:
    Content: Ether Mail (E-Mail for short) is an {ether:Ether}-based communications
      protocol. Developed by {Exavier Willoughby:Exavier/Exavier} in the 60s, it
      is the primary form of electromagical communication in use today.
  BodySections:
  - Content: 'Willoughby developed the E-Mail protocol in 1964 as a means to contact
      extra-dimensional beings that he believed to exist in the ether. Willoughby
      attempted to establish communication with these beings, which he called bogarts,
      for years, often claiming to friends and family that he was "one message away
      from salvation" and that the bogarts were "hiding in the folds" because he
      scared them with his genius.


      As he fell deeper into his bogart project,
      Willoughby attracted followers who wished to join him in his search. He expanded
      his protocol in 1966 with features to communicate with other humans, as well,
      although it was limited in its ability to communicate outside of a local ether
      network.


      The big breakthrough for E-Mail came in 1967, when Willoughby''s
      brother, an avowed bogart hunter, moved to another country. In order to stay
      in contact, Willoughby extended the E-Mail system to be able to contact humans
      anywhere on the etherweb, and the core of the modern E-Mail system was born.


      E-Mail
      retained a relatively consistent user base for the next few years. In 1971,
      <Magical University> professor Sean Furcotte joined the bogart hunters, and
      began sending communications to his students over E-Mail. That proved a massive
      hit, and the university established the first {collection service:E-Mail/Collection
      Service}, the Oak Tree on the Hill, the next year. Within months, the E-Mail
      userbase exploded to millions of users.


      In response to the sudden and
      unexpected burst of popularity, Willoughby dropped his bogart project entirely
      and decided to focus full-time on promoting and monetizing E-Mail. He founded
      {Exavier Purveyances:Exavier/Purveyances} and created his own E-Mail collector,
      Exavier''s Excellent E-Mail Emporium.


      As he worked to broaden its appeal,
      various other organizations and companies joined him, leading to the near-universal
      market share of the protocol today.'
    Title: History
  - Content: 'Addressing is the means by which a daemon or program implementing the
      E-Mail protocol determines where to send each letter. The current E-Mail protocol
      uses the form "<username> @ <Location Name>," where <Location Name> is either
      a personal physical address or the name of a third-party {E-Mail collection
      service:E-Mail/Collection Service}.


      Location names don''t need to be
      particularly descriptive - daemons are able to use their best judgment, username
      data, and word of mouth to locate users with non-descriptive location names.
      The E-Mail protocol has a built in scolding system for users who cause three
      or more delivery delays due to bad locations.


      Within each location,
      every username must be unique. However, usernames may be shared across locations.
      Issues can arise if a user has a physical addresses and moves to a new physical
      location where another user has the same username.


      For the above two
      reasons, it is recommended to try and use a unique name consisting of your
      name and additional identifying information; for example, "john_smith_furry_fanatic
      @ <Descriptive Location Name>."'
    Title: Addressing
  - Content: 'Every E-Mail capable machine must have under its employ an E-Mail courier
      daemon. This daemon is tasked with knowing the routing methods of the major
      collection services, in addition to the general geographical landscape of the
      surrounding polity.


      When an E-Mail is sent, this daemon takes the letter
      and delivers it to either the E-Mail master of the region containing the recipient''s
      address, or directly to the collection center.


      The E-Mail protocol
      does not specify how the letter is to reach its recipient from there, and the
      path it takes depends on the specific E-Mail master or collection service in
      question.'
