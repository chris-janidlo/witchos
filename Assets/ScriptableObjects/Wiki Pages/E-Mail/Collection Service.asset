  Title: E-Mail Collection Service
  LeadSection:
    Content: 'An E-Mail collection service, collection service, E-Mail collector,
      or collector, is a third party service that allows {E-Mails:E-Mail/E-Mail}
      to be delivered to end-users without using physical addresses.


      While
      personal addresses can offer greater delivery speeds and can protect against
      ether snooping, they are unreliable. Daemons who deliver to physical addresses
      are region locked, and cannot follow users when they move to a new address.


      Users
      must either share their updated address with their contact list, or maintain
      a "change of address" charm at their old address, which must be re-cast as
      frequently as once a week. Collection services bypass this issue with various
      systems that track users instead of locations.'
  BodySections:
  - Content: '* The Oak Tree on the Hill - the first collection service, founded
      in 1972 by <Magical University>. It''s free, open-source, distributed, peer-to-peer,
      and maintained by volunteers. Each node on the network is an ancient (at least
      300 year old) oak tree tended to by a nymph-sprite.


      * {Exavier:Exavier/Purveyances}''s
      Excellent E-Mail Emporium - also founded in 1972, in response to the popularity
      of the Oak Tree on the Hill with academics and technology workers. E-Mails
      sent to EEEE addresses are routed through the eponymous {Emporium:Exavier/Emporium},
      where daemons locate users based on a unique psychic profile that includes
      fears, desires, thought patterns, and embarrassing memories.


      * {Maco}
      E-Mail Services - the only subscription-based collector, with a strong enterprise
      flavor that makes it popular in the corporate world. Anchors a daemon to the
      user''s faculty of free will, and includes a convenient calendar for planning
      meetings.


      * Etherical Postal Service - a government service brought
      into effect by the Electromagical Communications Technology and Services Appropriation
      and Celebrating Our Veterans Act of 1979. Technically a hybrid between a true
      collector and a physical-address-based system, as every EPS E-Mail address
      must end with the identifier of a physical delivery box (ie, "username @ Etherical
      Postal Service #137").'
