    Content: '(not to be confused with the aether)


      The ether is the electromagical
      particle field and information network that powers computers and communication.
      The transistors and sprites that enable modern computers to work are all powered
      by the ether, and the etherweb runs on top of the whispers and perturbations
      of the field.'
