  Title: Witchipedia
  LeadSection:
    Content: Witchipedia is the name for the hyper-text knowledge base that comes
      pre-installed with {WitchOS}. Witchipedia was primarily developed by the Chronicler
      but is currently self-maintaining. It is unknown whether or not Witchipedia
      is sentient.
  BodySections:
  - Content: 'Hyper-text is normal text that is interspersed with clickable links
      that lead to other pages containing additional hyper-text. In Witchipedia, links
      appear as underlined text; e.g., {this link to the home page:~Home Page}. Links
      that the current user has never visited before appear in bold, while links that
      have been visited appear without the bold. TODO: demonstrate using a link that
      only would appear here


      Witchipedia is designed to ensure that users always get the knowledge they need
      to be a productive magus. The {home page:~Home Page} contains a section with
      links to pages that have only been half-read. Users are encouraged to visit
      it daily in order to receive helpful tips for productivity and metaphysics.'
    Title: Design
  - Content: 'Witchipedia was mostly written in C#, although some bugfixes were done
      via druidic ritual. There are published versions for every version of WitchOS,
      and additionally it has been known to spread to computers with color monitors.


      As WitchOS is self-documenting, Witchipedia is able to generate its content
      automagically by use of behavioral reflection. For content on topics outside
      of WitchOS itself, Witchipedia draws from the ancient and unkowable knowings.
      It is able to censor itself as necessary to prevent the annihiilation that usually
      occurs to humans who attempt to grasp such knowledge.'
