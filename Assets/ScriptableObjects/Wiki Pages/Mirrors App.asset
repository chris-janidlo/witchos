  Title: Mirrors
  LeadSection:
    Content: Mirrors is a sandboxed bad luck generator that comes pre-installed with
      WitchOS.
  BodySections:
  - Content: 'To infuse the operating system with bad luck, simply click the "BREAK"
      button below any of the mirrors. Now the bad luck is available for use in any
      spell that requires it (for example, TODO).


      After a mirror is broken and its magic is consumed, the mirror will repair itself
      automatically. The time this takes is always twice as long as the amount of
      time that passed between breaking the mirror and consuming its magic. For example,
      if you break a mirror, wait 5 minutes, and then cast a spell to consume its
      magic, the mirror will finish repairing itself 10 minutes later.'
    Title: Usage
  - Content: '* Mirrors was the fourth application to be developed for WitchOS, following
      PhaseVue, Mail, and hexterm. This was unintentional, but the added bad luck
      of the number four (which, in Chinese and other languages, is pronounced similarly
      to the word for "death") has a measurable impact on the quality of the bad luck
      that Mirrors generates.


      * While breaking analogue mirrors gives you seven years of bad luck, breaking
      a digital mirror gives you 111 years.


      * Mirrors was written in Boo.'
