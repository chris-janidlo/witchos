  Title: Mirrors
  LeadSection:
    Content: Mirrors is a sandboxed bad luck generator that comes pre-installed with
      WitchOS.
  BodySections:
  - Content: 'To infuse the operating system with bad luck, simply click on any of
      the mirrors. This creates a reservoir of unluckiness which can be consumed
      by spells and runes. Spells use bad luck automatically when they''re cast,
      if any is available.


      Each reservoir is only stable for a limited amount
      of time before collapsing in on itself. This time is tracked by the clock underneath
      each mirror. When a reservoir collapses, the mirror that created it becomes
      completely unusable until the next system reboot.


      Mirrors repair themselves
      automatically after their magic is consumed. The amount of time this takes
      depends on how long the user took to consume the magic after breaking the mirror.
      Each mirror has a different sweetspot where consuming the magic leads to the
      fastest repair time:


      1. Basic mirror - 7.5 seconds

      2. Evil Mirror
      - 15 seconds

      3. Ornate Mirror - 22.5 seconds


      When the mirror
      is repaired at the sweetspot time, it takes 1 second to repair. Farther away
      from the sweetspot results in slower repair times, up to 10 seconds. How close
      the mirror is to the sweetspot can also be seen in how fast the bad luck vortex
      in front of it is moving - faster means closer to the sweetspot.'
    Title: Usage
  - Content: '* Mirrors was the fourth application to be developed for WitchOS, following
      PhaseVue, Mail, and hexterm. This was unintentional, but the added bad luck
      of the number four (which, in Chinese and other languages, is pronounced similarly
      to the word for "death") has a measurable impact on the quality of the bad
      luck that Mirrors generates.


      * While breaking analogue mirrors gives
      you seven years of bad luck, breaking a digital mirror gives you 111 years.

      Mirrors was written in Boo.'
