  Title: Stub Curse
  LeadSection:
    Content: The stub curse is a hex that causes the target to injure one or more
      of their toes the next time they walk. It is one of the {level one spells:List
      of Level One Spells} that can be cast with {WitchOS}.
  BodySections:
  - Content: 'If the moon is in either of its Gibbous phases:

      * Run ''set aura nox''.

      * Run ''incant subgicatrix <target name>''.


      If the moon is in either of its Crescent phases:

      * Run ''set target <target name>''.

      * Run ''incant subgicatrix''.


      If the moon is Full:

      * Run ''set aura lux''.

      * Run ''incant subgicatrix <target name backward>''.


      Otherwise:

      * Run ''incant <target name> subgicatrix''.'
    Title: How to Cast
  - Content: The perprioceptors in the legs of the target are temporarily numbed,
      and a fog of anti-kinaesthesia is placed on the target's mental model of their
      feet. These effects are mediated by a minor demon from the second ring of the
      seventh circle of hell, but it is necessarily a very weak demon that is dispelled
      as soon as the physical damage to the toe happens. The demon escapes through
      the target's mouth, which usually manifests as a loud stream of prophanities.
