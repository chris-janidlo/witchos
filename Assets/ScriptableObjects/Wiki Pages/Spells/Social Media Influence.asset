    Title: How to Cast
  - Content: The social media influence has an aspect of Mercury, and usually wears
      off when it becomes visible in the sky. The effects vary based on the temperament
      of the target, but never cause significant or lasting issues. Recorded behaviors
      include sharing chain emails, engaging with suggestive content on one's primary
      account, and getting into arguments where neither side has any intention of
      changing their mind.
