  Title: Password Curse
  LeadSection:
    Content: The password curse is a curse that temporarily changes all the target's
      passwords to the word "password." It is one of the {level one spells:List of
      Level One Spells} that can be cast with {WitchOS}.
  BodySections:
  - Content: '* Run command ''xing <target name>''.

      * While that''s running,
      open a new hexterm window.

      * In the new window, run command ''set target
      <target name>''.

      * Also in the new window, run command ''incant signus
      salis''.'
    Title: How to Cast
  - Content: 'When this curse is cast, every alphanumeric access code assigned to
      the target is replaced with the word "password," or the equivalent in the target''s
      native language. This includes passwords to digital accounts (online or otherwise),
      alphanumeric keypads, and passcodes to enter private events such as organized
      crime hideouts. It has no effect on locks that are not alphanumeric, such as
      pin-and-tumbler locks or strictly numeric keypads.


      Although the effects
      may initially appear to be devastating, the spell''s hold on the target is
      tenuous due to the overextended astral sewing it requires. The curse can be
      reliably lifted through concerted mental energy on behalf of the target, which
      can take various forms. For example:

      * The target tries to login to
      a service with the correct password, fails, tries to login with a different
      password, fails again, and then retries the original password (without any
      modifications)

      * The target attempts to sign up for a service with a
      password that is too weak, and replaces any "a" characters with the "@" character

      *
      The target uses a password manager

      The curse lifts as soon as any such
      mental effort is exerted.'
