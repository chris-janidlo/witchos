  BodySections:
  - Content: "* Run 'seance <target name>' in order to commmune with the target's
      ancestors\n  * Make a note of which of their chants they repeated the most\n*
      Break a mirror\n* Run 'set aura negative'\n* Run 'incant malam fortunam <target
      name>. <most frequent chant>'"
    Title: How to Cast
  - Content: 'The target of the curse is doomed to small misfortunes for a short period
      of time. As with all luck-based magic, the effects are often subtle and can
      vary widely, but generally this hex only lasts a week.


      Any instances of bad luck are typically confined to events with high levels
      of variance. Some examples include dice rolls, weather fluctuations, and job
      applications. People who frequently gamble, such as stock traders, tend to get
      hit the hardest.'
