  Title: Borealeo Curse
  LeadSection:
    Content: The borealeo curse is a curse that causes temprorary hair loss. It is
      one of the {level one spells:List of Level One Spells} that can be cast with
      {WitchOS}.
  BodySections:
  - Content: '* Run ''set aura null''.

      * Break a mirror. If the moon is waning,
      break an additional mirror.

      * Run ''incant <target name> borealeo''.'
    Title: How to Cast
  - Content: The borealeo curse lacerates a portion of the hair follicles on the
      target's scalp, causing them to temporarily degrade and the hair shafts to
      disintigrate. The amount varies based on which sign is ascendant, but in most
      cases the target becomes completely bald for the duration of the curse. The
      follicles' memory of the damage typically only lasts for two weeks, at which
      point the curse subsides, but there has been one recorded case where the target
      remained permanently bald due to the strength of Leonian energy present.
