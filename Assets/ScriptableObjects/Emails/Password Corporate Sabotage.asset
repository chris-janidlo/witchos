  Body: 'Hello,


    I trust this email finds you well.


    The attached invoice
    targets the lead DevOps engineer supporting a certain consumer-facing web service.
    This service isn''t anything but a thinly veiled personal data farm, and no one
    seems to actually know where it''s all going. I have it on good authority he
    does not use a password manager, so once his passwords are compromised, I can
    deal a fatal blow to a system that exploits people out of their privacy.


    I
    appreciate your coordination in taking this down. I cordially request that you
    keep this quiet; we''re both professionals here, so let''s act like it. That
    said, if this information were to leak, let''s just say I have ways to plug things
    up.'
