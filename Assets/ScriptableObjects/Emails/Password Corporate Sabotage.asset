  Body: 'Hello,


    I trust this email finds you well.


    The attached invoice targets the lead DevOps engineer supporting a certain consumer-facing
    web service. This service isn''t anything but a thinly veiled personal data harvester,
    and no one seems to actually know where the data is going. Once his passwords
    are compromised, I can deal a fatal blow to a system that exploits people out
    of their privacy.


    I appreciate your coordination in taking this down. I cordially request that you
    keep this quiet; that said, if this information were to leak, I have ways to plug
    things. I''m a professional, just like you are, so let''s act like it.'
