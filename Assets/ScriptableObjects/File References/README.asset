      - "As you requested, this is a pretty basic install of WitchOS. I already hooked
        up your E-Mail account, so you should be getting requests immediately.\n  
        \n        If you need a refresher on spell casting, check out Witchipedia
        - it's an incredibly helpful resource if you ever have questions. There's
        a list of first level spells that you can get to from the homepage.\n\n   
        Don't forget to turn on magic using the menu on the bottom right. You only
        get 5 minutes of magic a day, so be sure you're prepared to fulfil your orders
        before turning it on.\n\n    Enjoy!\n\n    ~Corey Giles"
