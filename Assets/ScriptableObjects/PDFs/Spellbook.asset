    commands are entered in the spe// application\n\n- any time an instruction uses
    <>, replace everything inside the brackets including the brackets\n   - for example:
    if you are told to enter 'tn <target name>' and the name is 'John Smith', enter
    'tn John Smith'\n\n- 'incant' is the most important command - it's how you cast
    the final spell\n\n- make sure to check out the 'help' command for more info"
  - 'for temporary hair loss:



    - run command ''set aura null''


    - break a mirror, and if the moon is waning, break a second mirror


    - ''incant <target name> borealeo'''
  - 'simple spell to set every password to the word ''password''



    - run command ''xing <target name>''


    - while that is running, open a new spe// window


    - in the new window, run command ''set target <target name>''


    - run command ''incant piratica non grata'''
  - 'a hex for causing minor bodily injury, on the order of a stubbed toe


    if the moon is Gibbous (waxing or waning, no difference):

    - ''set aura nox''

    - ''set target <target name>''

    - ''incant subgicatrix''


    if the moon is Crescent:

    - ''set target <target name>''

    - ''incant subgicatrix''


    if the moon is Full:

    - ''set aura lux''

    - ''incant subgicatrix <target name>''


    if the moon is any other phase not mentioned above:

    - simply ''incant subgicatrix <target name backward>'' (make sure to reverse the
    name!)'
  - "a curse for moderate ill fortune, lasting of a week\n\n- commune with the aggrieved
    ancestors of the accursed, using command 'seance <target name>'\n   - take note
    of their most frequent chant\n- break a mirror\n- run 'set aura negative'\n\nfinally,
    'incant' the following formula:\n'malam <target name> fortunam <most frequent
    chant> horret'\n\nfor example, suppose the accursed is named John Smith and the
    most frequent chant from his ancestors was \"beware\"; then the command would
    become 'incant malam John Smith fortunum beware horret'"
  - 'here''s a charm that causes people to post embarrassing statuses online:


    note that this spell REQUIRES at least one (1) unbroken mirror in order to work


    - ''xing <target website>


    - in a new spe// window, ''incant facies libel <target name>'''
