    3. Run command ''incant <target name> borealeo''. The hex is now cast.'

    the moon is Full:\n- 'set aura lux'\n- 'incant subgicatrix <target name backward>'\n

    <target name>. <most frequent chant>\n\nFor example, suppose the Accursed is named
    Robert Smythe and the most frequent chant from his ancestors was \"beware\"; then
    the Command would become 'incant malam fortunum Robert Smythe. beware'."
