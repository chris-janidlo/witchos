  - 'As you requested, this is a pretty basic install of WitchOS. I already hooked
    up your E-Mail account, so you should be getting requests immediately.


    I went ahead and set you up with a spellbook including some starter curses to
    try out. You''''ll be spending a lot of time in the spe// application, so get
    used to that.


    Don''t forget to turn on magic using the menu on the bottom right. You only get
    5 minutes of magic a day, so be sure you''re prepared to fulfil your orders before
    turning it on.




    Enjoy!
