  - 'As you requested, this is a pretty basic install of WitchOS. I already hooked
    up your E-Mail account, so you should be getting requests immediately. I set the
    application up to auto-clean every day.



    I also set up the daily shut-down you asked for (11 PM). I even went ahead and
    set you up with a spellbook including some starter curses to try out. You''''ll
    be spending a lot of time in the spe// application, so get used to that.



    (When a spell says ''''incant'''', by the way, that means you have to run the
    command ''''incant'''' in spe//)



    Enjoy!


    Giles Corey'
