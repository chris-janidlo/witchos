.ase files can be opened and edited in Aseprite

in general, try to keep everything in Aseprite format, except for the few files that are never going to change (the borders, the empty sprite, the 1 pixel sprite, etc)
the only exception is mouse cursors, since they have to be imported a special way. keep the .ase file here and also export a png
