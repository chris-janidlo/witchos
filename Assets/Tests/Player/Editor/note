the resources folder here is used for loading assets during tests. it's in an editor folder so that it doesn't show up in released builds. (you can confirm the editor folder bit by writing and hooking up a terminal command that tries to load one of these resources. in builds, you'll see a null if there's an editor folder, but an object if there isn't one. either way, in the editor player, you'll still see an object)
