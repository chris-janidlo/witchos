gussy up spell casting:
	cool effects when a valid spell is loaded up in the terminal
	particle(?) effects when a spell fizzes out or is cast
	add eldritch runes to spell output with sprite tags

add retro computer system sounds as effects for things

alt-tab style switching

polish metatron UI
	magicy UI particles (blue highlight effect) coming from access button and source button when moused over
	golden rays of light coming from the same when magic is on

additional desktops

truer moon phase calculation using aasharp

expand text area of text viewer app to hide the paging area if there's only one page

break mirrors by clicking on their icons directly

fuzzy matching for closest match on spell regex

saveable window layout

audio player app

window auto tiling

global window resizing (ie, not just for active window)
	with this, probably some kind of mouse event rearchitecturing so that the interactions between dragging and other things under the mouse aren't as jank
