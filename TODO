TODO:
move spell requests to an invoice UI
	every day, get an email with an overview of your business (how many new orders you have, what your track record is, graphs? stuff like that)
	bi-modal order management app:
		mail-like invoice screen, with interactive previews for every invoice
			only have a certain number of slots for invoices. you are immediately presented with the option to buy more slots in the form of grayed-out slots with overlaid payment buttons
			each invoice preview at least has a button to open up for more details
				might also have buttons for declining (which means deleting) or accepting (which means adding to task list) as well
				invoice preview also shows the total amount and the due date. might also show payment scheme
			invoice details screen shows the customer name, a list of requested services, the due date, a total payment amount, a description of the payment scheme, and buttons for declining or accepting the order
				each individual requested service comes with its own justification line
				the payment scheme describes how the money will reach you. some examples are "all upfront," "half upfront and half immediately on completion," and "all the next day after completion"
			invoice preview and detail views both show the option to "turn in" once every sub task has been completed
		task list that shows a compact view of only the individual requested items, sorted by due date. these tasks are auto-cleared as soon as you complete them. maybe then the old tasks are replaced with a new one saying "turn in your work?"

move tutorial stuff to email
	get an email explaining new desktop functionality as you progress through the days
	have desktop email icon flash if you have an unread email

gussy up spell casting:
	cool effects when a valid spell is loaded up in the terminal
	particle(?) effects when a spell fizzes out or is cast
	add eldritch runes to spell output with sprite tags

add retro computer system sounds as effects for things

alt-tab style switching

make a minimum size for taskbar buttons, and when there are enough that they would normally drop below that size, make them scroll instead

polish metatron UI
	magicy UI particles (blue highlight effect) coming from access button and source button when moused over
	golden rays of light coming from the same when magic is on

additional desktops

truer moon phase calculation using aasharp

expand text area of text viewer app to hide the paging area if there's only one page

break mirrors by clicking on their icons directly

fuzzy matching for closest match on spell regex

saveable window layout

audio player app

window auto tiling

global window resizing (ie, not just for active window)
	with this, probably some kind of mouse event rearchitecturing so that the interactions between dragging and other things under the mouse aren't as jank
